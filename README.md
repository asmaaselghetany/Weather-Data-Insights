# Weather Data Insights

This project provides an insightful analysis of **weather data**, using data manipulation, visualization, and statistical techniques to explore various weather trends and patterns. The goal is to uncover hidden insights from a historical weather dataset to help make informed decisions related to weather conditions.

## **Project Overview**

In this project, we analyze weather data over time to answer key questions related to global and local weather patterns. We apply statistical techniques, visualizations, and machine learning to gain insights into:

- Temperature fluctuations and patterns.
- Humidity levels and their correlations with temperature.
- Rainfall and its frequency over time.
- Seasonal changes and anomalies in weather patterns.
  
The project uses **Python**, **Pandas**, **Matplotlib**, and **Seaborn** to perform data wrangling, exploratory data analysis, and data visualization.
